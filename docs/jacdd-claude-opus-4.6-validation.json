          "q2": "Misalignment = 1 − Dice score. If the Dice score is 0.3, misalignment is 0.7. A Dice score of 0.3 falls into the LOW alignment band, indicating small overlap with major direction gaps between the acceptable and potential solution spaces.",
          "q3": "Real-world solution spaces are fuzzy, graded, and uncertain—not binary checklists. Modeling them as PDFs captures this continuous uncertainty and gradation. A sticky note in the braindump explicitly states \"These are probability density functions,\" reflecting that acceptability and producibility are distributions, not discrete sets.",
          "q4": "Good signals: the stakeholder pauses (not obvious), says \"good question\" (surfaced latent tradeoff), is forced to choose between two defensible options, and the question is concrete/scenario-based rather than abstract. The 50ms-stale-data example qualifies because it forces a concrete latency-vs-freshness tradeoff right on a decision boundary.",
          "q5": "Delta constraints express requirements as changes relative to the current state (e.g., \"reduce response time by 50%\" instead of an absolute target). JACDD prefers them when a system exists because they compose naturally with iteration and reduce cognitive burden, aligning with iterative development's incremental nature.",

The judge consumes both sections to sharpen estimates of the acceptable and potential spaces.",
          "q7": "At iteration 0 with maximum uncertainty and no history, the judge should dominate with interview questions; constraint suggestions grow as the model matures. Initial actions: create the personality file from a codebase inventory (team section) and the stated goal (stakeholder skeleton section).",

          "q9": "The judge examines git history for signals: commit granularity (chunking style), message framing (priorities), co-location vs. separation (conceptual grouping), and sequencing (dependency thinking). These feed the team section of the personality file, refining the potential space model. The principle: commit with intention, as if the judge will read it to learn how you think.",

Adopting JACDD does not replace Scrum because JACDD is an alignment layer only, designed to pair with a delivery process like Scrum."

Discrete sets or checklists cannot represent this continuous, probabilistic nature of stakeholder preferences and team capabilities.",

JACDD prefers them over absolute constraints when a system exists because they reduce cognitive burden and compose naturally with iterative development—each iteration builds on the previous state rather than re-specifying from scratch.",
