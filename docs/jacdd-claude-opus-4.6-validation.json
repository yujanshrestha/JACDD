          "q3": "Stakeholder: defines the acceptable space via constraints and interview answers. Team (people + tools + codebase): defines the potential space. Judge: estimates alignment, asks boundary questions, suggests constraints, and consumes the personality file to model both spaces simultaneously — the only role modeling both.",
          "q4": "Good signals: stakeholder pauses (not obvious), says 'good question' (surfaced latent tradeoff), forces choice between two defensible options, and is concrete/scenario-based not abstract. The 50ms-stale-data question qualifies because it forces a concrete latency-vs-freshness tradeoff between two defensible positions.",
          "q5": "The four steps: (1) Estimate both spaces and alignment band, (2) Interview with 3–5 boundary questions targeting largest divergences, (3) Suggest 2–4 actionable constraints ranked by alignment impact, (4) Repeat until HIGH. At iteration 0, interview questions dominate; constraint suggestions grow as the model matures. Artifacts created: initial personality file from codebase inventory (team section) and stakeholder goal (stakeholder skeleton).",

Examples from the source: absolute — 'Windowing controls operable during scroll'; delta — 'reduce frame latency by 30% from current baseline.'",
          "q7": "The personality file (jacdd-personality.md at project root) has two sections: a stakeholder section (preferences, judgement patterns, revealed priorities, decision tendencies — fed by interviews) and a team section (strengths, weaknesses, tools, habits, blind spots — fed by codebase and git history). The judge updates it after every iteration; humans can edit anytime. It sharpens estimates of both the acceptable and potential spaces.",
          "q8": "JACDD is NOT: (1) project management (no sprints, no velocity), (2) a replacement for BDD/Agile/delivery frameworks, (3) automating judgement — it amplifies it, (4) a specification language — constraints take any form. It is an alignment layer only, meant to be paired with a delivery process.",
          "q9": "Interview questions asked: (1) windowing adjustments pause scroll or inline? (2) 200ms frame-to-frame latency acceptable? (3) multi-monitor layouts at launch? The answer 'Inline. Pausing breaks clinical workflow.' directly became the constraint 'Windowing controls operable during scroll.' The latency answer became '≤200ms' constraint; multi-monitor became 'deferred (explicit out-of-scope).' These constraints moved alignment from LOW to MODERATE.",

Specific signals: (1) commit granularity (chunking style), (2) message framing (priorities), (3) co-location vs separation (conceptual grouping), (4) sequencing (dependency thinking).

          "q2": "Misalignment = 1 − Dice(f,g), where Dice(f,g) = ∫ min(f(x), g(x)) dx. Range is 0 to 1. Dice = 0 means the two spaces barely overlap (critical misalignment). Dice = 1 means perfect overlap (the team would build exactly what stakeholders accept). Misalignment inverts this.",

The 50ms-stale-data question qualifies because it forces a real trade-off between competing defensible values, prompting genuine deliberation that narrows the acceptable space.",

Pausing breaks clinical workflow.' revealed that any modal/blocking interaction was unacceptable. This became a constraint such as 'annotations must be inline; no workflow-pausing modals,' directly narrowing the acceptable space and moving alignment from LOW to MODERATE by eliminating a major divergence region.",
